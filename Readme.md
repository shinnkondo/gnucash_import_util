# GNU Cash Import Util

Utility scripts to import csv files into gnucash databse.

Scripts depend on a third party library piecash, since it seemed to provide convenient APIs in terms of both documentations and design.

Aiming to support other csvs that I would mainly use, but there is no intention to make them generic enough.
